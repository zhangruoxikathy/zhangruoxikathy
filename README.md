As someone passionate about Finance and Data Analytics, I thrive on using quantitative models to tackle challenges in the financial industry and enjoy crafting compelling visualizations to tell a story. My background includes valuable experiences in Financial Industry Consulting, Private Equity, FinTech, Portfolio Management, and Equity Research.
